I tried to find a weighted mean for my music preferences

Only bands that I have listened to enough to have an opinion on were included.
Scatter plots were digitized with [PlotDigitizer](https://plotdigitizer.com) and weighting was performed by adding a column to the CSV, representing how much I like the band (from 1-10).
